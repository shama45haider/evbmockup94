<p>Beyond that, anything extra you have is a bonus but not required.

      reply: `<p>Yes, we buy diamonds and colored gemstones. For diamonds, we look at cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. If you have a GIA certificate, that definitely helps — it speeds things up and can get you a better offer. But we can evaluate without one too.</p>
<p>We also buy sapphires, rubies, emeralds, and other fine stones — loose or mounted, both are fine. One thing to note: we don't buy moissanite or lab-grown stones as precious gems.</p>`

      matchAny: true,
      reply: `<p>Watches are a big one for us — we buy luxury, vintage, and select sport watches every day. Rolex (Submariner, Daytona, Datejust, GMT, Explorer), Omega, Tudor, Breitling, TAG Heuer, Cartier, Panerai, IWC — all the major names. For Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, we prefer a heads-up first, but we buy those too.</p>
<p>Box and papers definitely help and can increase the offer, but they're not required. We verify serials and check the movement in-store. Honestly, the easiest first step is to text us a photo at <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a> — or just walk in.</p>`

Louis Vuitton (Speedy, Neverfull, Keepall, Pochette), Chanel (Classic Flap, Boy, WOC), Gucci, Dior, Saint Laurent, Prada, Fendi, Bottega Veneta, Celine — all of those. For Hermès, Kelly and Birkin included, though those we prefer by appointment.</p>
<p>The dust bag, box, and receipt are nice to have and can bump up the offer, but they're not required. We authenticate everything in-store. If you want a rough idea before making the trip, just text photos to <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a>.</p>`

      reply: `<p>We buy sneakers every day — deadstock and gently worn pairs both welcome. Air Jordan retros and collabs, Nike Dunks, Adidas Yeezy (350, 500, 700, Foam Runner), New Balance collabs, Travis Scott, Off-White, Fragment — that's our bread and butter.</p>
<p>If you have the OG box, bring it — it helps the offer. We use live market pricing, not the lowball numbers you'd get from a kiosk. Most sneaker visits are done in about 10 minutes. Walk in or text photos to <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a>.</p>`

      reply: `<p>We buy hype streetwear and curated vintage — Supreme, Off-White, BAPE, Palace, Kith collabs, Fear of God. For vintage, we love band and tour tees from the 80s through early 2000s, Carhartt and Schott jackets, Levi's, 90s and Y2K pieces, Harley and sports vintage.</p>
<p>Condition matters a lot here, and we don't buy fast fashion or bulk clothing. If you're not sure whether something qualifies, just text photos to <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a> and we'll give you a quick answer before you make the trip.</p>`

      matchAny: true,
      reply: `<p>Broken stuff is totally fine — don't let that stop you from bringing it in. Broken chains, single earrings, bent rings, scrap gold, damaged watches — the metal and stone content still have real value regardless of condition. We evaluate based on what's actually there, not just how it looks. Bring it in and we'll tell you exactly what we'd offer.</p>`

      reply: `<p>We deal with estate and inherited items all the time — it's a pretty common situation. Families clearing out an apartment or liquidating a collection can bring in a mixed box of stuff — jewelry, watches, bags, coins, electronics — and we'll evaluate everything and give you one clear payment. We explain each offer so nothing feels rushed or confusing.</p>
<p>For large collections it really helps to text photos to <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a> ahead of time so we can make sure we have enough time set aside. But walk-ins are welcome too.</p>`

      matchAny: true,
      reply: `<p>It depends on the item, but here's the general idea: for gold and silver, we weigh it and test purity right in front of you, then price it against live spot rates. For diamonds and gems, we look at cut, clarity, color, and carat — a GIA cert helps. For watches, it's brand, model, serial number, condition, and whether you have box and papers. For designer bags, authentication and original packaging matter. For sneakers, we check style, size, condition, and use live resale market data.</p>
<p>We can't give exact quotes over the phone, but texting photos to <a href="${SMS_URL}">${PHONE}</a> will get you a rough ballpark before you come in.</p>`

      reply: `<p>Yes, we do both — outright purchase or consignment. Most people go with the instant cash offer since it's quick and simple. But consignment is an option if you'd rather wait and potentially get a higher number — we sell the item for you and pay you when it moves. When you come in, we can walk you through both so you can decide what makes more sense for your situation.</p>`
